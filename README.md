## Project Overview

NodeFlow aims to solve the challenge of creating dynamic, adaptable AI-driven workflows by providing a modular, node-based system that integrates various data sources and LLM nodes. It is intended to facilitate easy setup and management of data pipelines, specifically for backend engineers and developers seeking to incorporate AI-driven insights into complex, multi-step workflows without extensive front-end design requirements. This tool is designed for backend engineers and AI developers looking for a streamlined way to integrate conditional LLM processing and handle dynamic data flow in diverse use cases, from data analysis to AI-based recommendation systems.

## Features

- **Modular Node-based Architecture**: Create custom workflows by chaining nodes with various behaviors (data fetching, LLM processing, conditional logic).
- **Conditional LLM Processing (WIP)**: Dynamically process data and conditionally execute nodes based on LLM outputs (currently in development).
- **Configurable Workflow Management**: Define complex workflows with minimal setup using YAML or programmatic configuration.
- **Future Plans**: Expand conditional capabilities, add more data source integrations, and improve API for easier external use.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone this repository (ensure itâ€™s private):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NodeFlow.git

   2.	Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

cd NodeFlow

    3.	Install any necessary dependencies:

# Example for Maven:

mvn install

# OR for Gradle:

./gradlew build

Usage

Currently, usage documentation is limited, but the general workflow involves: 1. Running initial setup commands. 2. Configuring nodes and workflows in the config.yaml file or directly through the API.

Detailed usage instructions, including examples and templates, will be added as features are finalized.

Roadmap

In-progress and planned updates:
â€¢ Initial setup and configuration for custom workflows
â€¢ Complete conditional logic support for LLM responses (WIP)
â€¢ Add user documentation and examples
â€¢ Prepare for public release and add contribution guidelines
